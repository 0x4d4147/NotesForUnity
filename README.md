# Unity Notes Asset  

To use simply add the NotesBehaviour.cs to any GameObject. You can view all notes by going to "Window/Gather Notes" and selecting "Refresh Notes." This will list all notes in the scene. Clicking on a note in the "Gather Notes" window will select the object in the scene and highlight in the hierarchy.
